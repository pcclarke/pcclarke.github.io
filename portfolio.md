			<p class="body">For my final project in IAT 355: Visual Analytics, I was tasked with making an interactive data visualization of my choice. I chose to visualize a data set from a book that I liked, Gregory Clark's A Farewell to Alms. But while I thought the data set was interesting, there wasn't any particular story that I wanted to tell with the data. I went through many sketches trying to figure out just what kind of visualization to make.</p>
			<p class="body">Eventually, I realized that exploring the data was in fact the most interesting part of this data set because there are many stories being told with it â€“ the Napoleonic wars, the Irish potato famine, and many others in this time period. My final design focused on drilling down from the long span of 400 years, into a managable number of years for comparison. Each step along the way uses a slightly different type of time plot, most notably, the series of bandlines along the left.</p>

	<div id="applyBC2Feature" class="feature">

		<p>After the new SFU undergraduate application on ApplyBC went live (see above), I was responsible for planning and conducting a user study to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the application.</p>

				<p class="body">With this being the first of many user tests on the new ApplyBC applications, it was important to set a baseline. I was given extra time to prepare, which I used to write a detailed test plan and research the think-aloud method throughly. My goal was to design a test that was rigorous, repeatable, and produced useful results.</p>
				<p class="body">The user test went remarkably smoothly. We had exactly the number of recruits we needed and all tests ran on schedule. Our findings were summarized in a report describing exactly where usability problems were found and their severity. It will be used to prioritize the upgrades made to ApplyBC and it will shape the next series of designs.</p>

			<p class="body">This started off innocuously, as a Christmas present for my father. He's a long-time fan of Civilization 4, and I thought it would look nice on his wall.</p>
			<p class="body">Then I tried to untangle the mess of prerequisites and paths in the Civilization 4 technology tree. Far from being a tree it's more like a hairball of different pathways and hidden requirements. With this poster, I managed to straighten out the knots, and learned a whole lot about a game I thought I had pretty much mastered!</p>

			<p class="body">In fall 2015, I took a course in typography at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Aside from a general interest as a designer, I realized that typefaces (or fonts, if you must) are especially important for the web because they scale so well.</p>
			<p class="body">The goal of this poster was to showcase a typeface. I was interested in blackletter type because I had rarely used it, and I thought it would prove to be an interesting challenge to research. That led me to discovering Unger Fraktur, a somewhat forgotten but attractive variant of the Fraktur blackletter family.</p>
