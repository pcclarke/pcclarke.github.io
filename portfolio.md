			<p class="body">In fall 2015, I took a course in typography at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Aside from a general interest as a designer, I realized that typefaces (or fonts, if you must) are especially important for the web because they scale so well.</p>
			<p class="body">The goal of this poster was to showcase a typeface. I was interested in blackletter type because I had rarely used it, and I thought it would prove to be an interesting challenge to research. That led me to discovering Unger Fraktur, a somewhat forgotten but attractive variant of the Fraktur blackletter family.</p>

			<p class="body">As part of a course on interaction design, myself and a teammate were tasked to create an extremely minimalist or maximalist design. Since minimalism is already so popular and common in design, we took the more interesting path and went maximal. We intended to build a wall that facilitated interaction between rooms and was interactive in and of itself.</p>
			<p class="body">Our first design was a wall that included an adjustable door, pull-out tables and chairs, plus a projector. However, this proved to be difficult to communicate, let alone pull off in a prototype. We then moved towards simpler designs, trying to find a means to still accomplish our maximalist goals with the fewest elements. It turned out that just one thing was needed: rope. Rope could be easily modified to fit users needs, and it unexpectedly opened up our design to play.</p>

	<div id="applyBC1Feature" class="feature">
		<img src="/portfolio-res/applybc/landing.jpg" />
		<p>For eight months in 2012, I did a SFU co-op internship at <a href="http://www.bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a>. I worked on an upgrade to the SFU undergraduate application at <a href="https://applybc.ca">ApplyBC</a>, from design to implementation.</p>

			<p class="body">My co-op term at BCcampus began as the design wireframes in Balsamiq were being completed. I helped with these wireframes by creating click-through versions of the wireframes, which could be used for immediate testing. The click-through wireframes revealed many small features that had been overlooked on the first pass, such as pop-up boxes and error messaging. As well, the click-through wireframes were used to present the design to SFU's project management office.</p>
			<p class="body">After the wireframes were complete, BCcampus' designer built more detailed prototypes in Adobe InDesign. I assisted here too, and then created a layout template for the new ApplyBC SFU application in HTML and CSS. This template was then used by myself and other members of the BCcampus engineering team to complete the front end of the application. Once that was completed, I shifted to documenting the java GWT variables and organizing our QA testing of the upgraded application.</p>

I was given extra time to prepare, which I used to write a detailed test plan and research the think-aloud method throughly. My goal was to design a test that was rigorous, repeatable, and produced useful results.</p>
				<p class="body">The user test went remarkably smoothly. We had exactly the number of recruits we needed and all tests ran on schedule. Our findings were summarized in a report describing exactly where usability problems were found and their severity. It will be used to prioritize the upgrades made to ApplyBC and it will shape the next series of designs.</p>

			<p class="body">This was created in a course in digital art &#8211; not in using technology as a tool to create art, but creating technology that is capable of producing art. A recurring theme in that course was artists who were interested in the rough edges of technology. Such as Jodi site, a "web art" site that creates striking displays out by breaking HTML (and often browsers). While taking this course in digital art, I had been doing my own research on information visualization and data design.</p>
			<p class="body">Somehow, these two ideas merged into "what if I intentionallycreated disinformation design?" To begin, I had planned on only creating a Processing application, which would stand on its own.However, after reading Edward Tufte's discussion of magicians in his book Visual Explanations, I changed the project into a performance art. The charts generated by the ChartJunker are meant to be used as a compliment to a performer doing a trick, like a magician's hat.</p>

				<p class="body">This project grew out of a problem at my Toastmasters (public speaking) club. During exam time at school, many members were not preparing for the meetings because they were too busy studying. Knowing this, other members weren't showing up. The biggest problem was the Table Topics Master, who presents topics that members can turn into short, impromptu speeches. But if no topics have been prepared, we would rush to write topics at the last minute. I created the Table Topics Machine to fill in for the Table Topics Master and save us from those panics. It works like a Mad Libs game: I wrote a number of phrases with gaps in them, which are either randomly filled in or filled in using categories selected by the user. The results are usually bizarre, and always entertaining. It's been very popular, perhaps even too popular when members started asking for it even when I wrote my own topics!</p>

			<p class="body">This project was created to suit a local community group, which in my team's case was the SFU Surrey chapter of the Engineers Without Borders. We noticed that in their weekly discussions the laptops which they all used were as much a hindrance as a help. Discussions tended to be led by one member by a whiteboard, and everyone else focused on their laptops or the leader but not each other. The hexboards were created to bring the whiteboard - and the discussion - to the group.</p>
			<p class="body">The HexBoard itself is a hexagon with a whiteboard on one side, and a magnet on the back. It's intended to be used as a way to stimulate ideas in a group setting, allowing people to mix and match their ideas like a sort of board game. The magnet on the rear makes it possible to attach the HexBoards to a whiteboard for further discussion, or perhaps as storage on a magnetic surface.</p>

			<p class="body">This was a long project that spanned over the final month of my Spatial Design course. It began with a trip to Seattle, where we visited many of the buildings and public spaces that had been examined earlier in the course. The project was to find a site in Myrtle Edwards Park where we would design a 3d model of small building that creatively used light, hence the name Pavilion of Light. I found an area well along the park, where there was a small, forgotten memorial to a former Port of Seattle director. My team's goal was to expand and rehabilitate this memorial into our building.</p>
			<p class="body">Unfortunately disaster struck after Seattle when the one person in my team who knew anything about 3d modeling fell ill, and did not get better until well after the course was completed. I decided to use this as an opportunity to move from my research and writing role into learning 3d modeling myself. As the examples here show, I was sucesfully able to go from knowing nothing to being lead modeler for my team in just a few days.</p>
			<p class="body">With only myself and two teammates, my role on this project was large. I was involved fully in the design of building, the research, and presentations - especially the maps. With so many parts in the project, much of my time went simply into organizing myself and my team such that we would be ready for the presentations. Yet despite my reduced team (others had as many as six people) I was quite pleased when the lecturer called my team's project "the most original in this class".</p>
