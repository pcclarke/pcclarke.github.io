SEN_What makes %CLBRTY's music art?
SEN_You and a group of friends have formed a new rap group, '%GRTNAM'. What will you rap about?
SEN_In a song about %GROUPS, %CLBRTY rapped that they would '%HARMAC'. Is this offensive to %GROUPS?
SEN_Parents across %PLACEI have condemned %CLBRTY's new rap song glamorizing drinking %DRINKY to excess. Do you think the parents are right to be angry?
SEN_%CLBRTY has remixed %SONNAM into a rap song about %VILEAC. The critics have lauded it, but do you think it's an appropriate remix?
