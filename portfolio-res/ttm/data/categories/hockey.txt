SEN_Hockey players in the %ORGNZG were badly %BADSIT in their last game, and they have asked you to deliver a  motivational speech to prepare them for the next big game!
SEN_%CLBRTY has said that too many hockey players have been %BADSIT and that it's ruining the game for fans. Do you agree?
SEN_%CLBRTY has opened a new hockey-themed bar, '%GRTNAM'. Would you want to go there?
SEN_The NHL has decided to end the practice of singing the national anthem before hockey games after %CURBND's performance was so bad that the Canadian government demanded an official apology. Do you support the NHL's decision?
SEN_Fans of the %ORGNZG are said to commit %VILEAC in hockey games. Why do you think they are so aggressive?
