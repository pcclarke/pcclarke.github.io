                <p>This was a lengthy project I worked on for my last two years in SIAT, which started as a directed studies course with Professor <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~shaw/">Chris Shaw</a> and then grew into a research assistant position in his lab. The concept was straightforward: create data visualizations based on Fitbit data to encourage people with arthritis to get more exercise. These would be used by physiotherapists to monitor and assist their patients’ health.</p>

                <p>My early work on this project was a mix of trying to figure out if the concept could work, and creating designs to go with it. I learned how to access the Fitbit API, using their OAuth 1.0a authentication, which allowed me to create some basic interactive prototypes in Processing. For designs I sketched many concepts that used calendars as “data cards” which could be shared on social media. These interfaces were mocked up in Axure.</p>

                <p>But when we presented these first concepts and prototypes to the group of physiotherapists we were partnered with, we discovered we hadn’t understood their needs. I was trying to encourage users get more exercise, but people with arthritis can't and shouldn't move too much. They need just the right amount of exercise to get their joints flexible without causing injury. This made visualizing the goal that much harder. Different users might need to get exercise at different times of the day for some limited amount.</p>

                <p>One of the more amusing features I came up with was a system to allow users to bet on each others' success. If you achieve your fitness goal for that week, you collect the money, lose and it goes to a charity of your choice. It didn't go over well with the physiotherapists.</p>

                <p>After many redesigns and prototypes, I needed a different approach. Instead of redesigning the visualizations, I tried redesigning the data. Up until this point, I had used the per-minute Fitbit steps calories data. I wrote an algorithm to chunk the data into bouts of continuous activity. This proved to be a huge breakthrough, opening up a watershed of useful designs that did exactly what the physiotherapists were looking for. With some refinements, and a switch to visualizing in d3.js, I had a design that could be implemented as a system.</p>

                <p>We went through a lot of prototypes on this project, because energy efficiency is not an especially intuitive concept. Early on, I eagerly investigated the technical side of the project. The city had connected many of their buildings to an API that tracked natural gas consumption and water use. I worked with city officials to learn about how these systems worked to understand and inspire my designs. Using what I learned from them and the building data, I created visualizations in Processing and small physical prototypes with Arduino.</p>

                <p>Creating so many prototypes, going through critiques, and the repeated presentations to the city staff took a serious toll on the team and myself. Each week we had to push out another iteration, creating more prototypes and presenting the latest versions of our designs. We had make diagrams to explain our designs, explain what materials we would use, and videos of scenarios. As time dragged on, I found myself taking on a larger role in the project. I ended up building most of the prototypes myself, and creating all of the graphics in the hopes of salvaging the project.</p>

                <p>For my final project in my introductory visual analytics course, the assignment was to create an interactive data visualization of my choice. Of course, the challenge when you can do just about anything is settling on a topic. Being a history buff I first tried to visualize the data set of long-term city demographics in Tertius Chandler’s book Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth. My first sketches were promising, but I was soon taught a hard lesson in acquiring data: transcribing data sets by hand is time consuming.</p>

                <p>Sticking to my history theme, I chose to visualize a data set from another book, Gregory Clark's A Farewell to Alms on the prices of English farm goods. Thankfully, Clark posted his data on his website in convenient CSV form. This made getting a few early prototypes working quite easy, which inspired more sketches. But while I thought the data set was interesting, there wasn't any particular story that I wanted to tell with the data. I went through many sketches trying to figure out just what kind of visualization to make.</p>

                <p>I realized that exploring the data was in fact the most interesting part of this data set because there are many stories being told with it – the Napoleonic wars, the Irish potato famine, and many others in this time period. My final design focused on drilling down from the long span of 400 years into a manageable number of years for comparison. Each step along the way uses a slightly different type of time plot so that users can compare and view farm goods. The most notable are the bandlines, a concept borrowed from <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/introducing_bandlines.pdf">Stephen Few</a>, which makes it easier to spot high and low points in the history of the price.</p>

                <p>The user test went remarkably smoothly. We had exactly the number of recruits we needed and all tests ran on schedule. Our findings were summarized in a report describing exactly where usability problems were found and their severity. I was responsible for designing and editing the report, in addition to writing much of it. The report was used to prioritize the subsequent upgrades made to ApplyBC, which have since corrected the issues we found.</p>

            <p>A redesign of the technology tree Sid Meier's Civilization 4 for accuracy and clarity.</p>

                <p>This started off innocuously, as a Christmas present for my father. He's a long-time fan of Civilization 4, and I thought it would be nice for him to have a copy on his wall, made more legible and more clearly labeled than the the one that came in the box.</p>

                <p>The original technology tree appears to be a linear path from left to right. However, the arrows have different meanings. One arrow is a mandatory path, two are different options. Some paths aren't even shown as lines, instead they are indicated by icons in the upper right of each box.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <p>However, once I started trying to understand the workings of the technology tree, I realized this was actually one of the most complex tree structures I had ever encountered. It’s a non-linear tree with many overlapping paths, more like a maze than a tree. The original designer’s approach was to hide this, making the chart look much simpler than it actually was. My first attempt at a design was to reveal the hidden paths and organize them.</p>

            <div class="right">
                <p>A first try at redesigning the tree, showing all of the paths that were hidden and identifying optional paths by colour. A major improvement in consistency, but much more of a maze.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <div class="left">
                <p>The biggest issue I identified with this first draft was that the paths were often extremely long, which made it very likely that they would overlap. I tried shifting the positions of the technologies around, with little luck doing better. Some brief experiments with algorithms to optimize the nodes suggested there wasn’t much to gain. So instead, I tried wrapping the nodes around in a circle.</p>

                <p>I’ve gone from a maze to a hairball. Not much progress, it seemed.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <p>Finally, it hit on me to try merging the circle and tree concepts into one: this allowed for me to create a visually clear arrangement for the paths with a minimum amount of space. It also made for a good visual metaphor, showing the progress of technology in game as spokes in a wheel.</p>

            <p>A small poster to describe and display the unique features of the modern-fraktur hybrid typeface, Unger Fraktur.</p>

                <p>In fall 2015, I took a course in typography at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Aside from a general interest as a designer, I realized that typefaces (or fonts, if you must) are especially important for the web. As vector objects they scale well, which is a useful feature when creating responsive designs.</p>

                <p>The goal of this poster was to showcase a typeface. I was interested in blackletter type because I had rarely used it, and I thought it would prove to be an interesting challenge to research. That led me to discovering Unger Fraktur, a somewhat forgotten but attractive variant of the Fraktur blackletter family.</p>

                <p>My approach to the poster was to inform designers about what made Unger Fraktur unique, hopefully encouraging them to use it (and use it properly). I highlighted the predecessors of Unger Fraktur, older fraktur blackletters and Didot. In particular, I examined the components of the glyphs, showing how they borrowed and combined parts from such wildly different typefaces.</p>
