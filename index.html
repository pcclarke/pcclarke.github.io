                <p>For my final project in my introductory visual analytics course, the assignment was to create an interactive data visualization of my choice. Of course, the challenge when you can do just about anything is settling on a topic. Being a history buff I first tried to visualize the data set of long-term city demographics in Tertius Chandler’s book Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth. My first sketches were promising, but I was soon taught a hard lesson in acquiring data: transcribing data sets by hand is time consuming.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <p>Sticking to my history theme, I chose to visualize a data set from another book, Gregory Clark's A Farewell to Alms on the prices of English farm goods. Thankfully, Clark posted his data on his website in convenient CSV form. This made getting a few early prototypes working quite easy, which inspired more sketches. But while I thought the data set was interesting, there wasn't any particular story that I wanted to tell with the data. I went through many sketches trying to figure out just what kind of visualization to make.</p>

            <div class="left">
                <p>I realized that exploring the data was in fact the most interesting part of this data set because there are many stories being told with it – the Napoleonic wars, the Irish potato famine, and many others in this time period. My final design focused on drilling down from the long span of 400 years into a manageable number of years for comparison. Each step along the way uses a slightly different type of time plot so that users can compare and view farm goods. The most notable are the bandlines, a concept borrowed from Stephen Few, which makes it easier to spot high and low points in the history of the price.</p>

                    <p>With this being the first of many user tests on the new ApplyBC applications, it was important to set a baseline. I was given extra time to prepare, which I used to write a detailed test plan and research the think-aloud method throughly. My goal was to design a test that was rigorous, repeatable, and produced useful results.</p>

                    <p>The user test went remarkably smoothly. We had exactly the number of recruits we needed and all tests ran on schedule.

It will be used to prioritize the upgrades made to ApplyBC and it will shape the next series of designs.</p>

                <p>This was a major and lengthy project I worked on for my last two years in SIAT, first as a directed studies and then as a research assistant. The idea was straightforward enough: make Fitbit, normally intended for increasing exercise, to work for people with arthritis, who can't and shouldn't move too much. They need just the right amount of exercise, not too much and not too little, so that their joints remain flexible.</p>

                <p>The design ended up being quite difficult, because it's a very abstract concept to represent. Quantities are easy to show, by displaying the position of a line, bar, or something similar. But how to show a quantity that must be "right"? After many sketches, prototypes, and revisions I eventually hit on a winning concept: redesign the data, not just the visualization.</p>
