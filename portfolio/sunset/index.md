            <p>This project was for a course in speculative design, where we would apply design thinking to solve real problems faced by the City of Vancouver.  My team was working on a project to help the city communicate to the public the gains they had made in getting their buildings up to the highest energy efficiency standards.</p>

            <p>An early concept showing energy use as a friendly "pillow" to be placed around city buildings. Hygene concerns ruled this idea out.</p>

            <p>We went through a lot of prototypes on this project, because energy efficiency is not an especially intuitive concept. Early on, I eagerly investigated the technical side of the project. The city had connected many of their buildings to an API that tracked natural gas consumption and water use. I worked with city officials to learn about how these systems worked to understand and inspire my designs. Using what I learned from them and the building data, I created visualizations in Processing and small physical prototypes with Arduino.</p>

            <p>Combining a display panel and water installation to show energy use physically. Interesting in theory, hard to prototype well with the amount of time we had.</p>

            <p>Creating so many prototypes, being critiqued, and presenting to city staff took a serious toll on the team and myself. Each week we pushed out another iteration, creating more prototypes and presenting the latest versions of our designs. We had to make diagrams that explained our designs, showed what materials we would use, and videos of scenarios. As time dragged on, I found myself taking on a larger role in the project. I ended up building most of the prototypes myself, and creating all of the graphics to keep up with the pace of the project.</p>

            <p>Using air pressure in balloons to represent the energy use. Seemed like a good concept, but the actual design needed some work. It also proved difficult to get the air pressure high enough to inflate the balloon in our prototypes.</p>

            <p>Despite many rough edges – “you’re still one more iteration away from getting it right” said the professor – I did manage to produce a fully functional scale prototype. An Arduino in the prototype connected to the city's green buildings, delivering live energy usage data that controlled motors in the prototype. After so much toil, I was relieved and proud to have a solid proof of a good design.</p>

            <p>Instead of putting the balloons on poles, we put the balloons on walls. Then we powered them with fans, which were much easier to build, resulting in the final design: sails!</p>
