            <p>While an intern at BCcampus, I worked on a project to upgrade <a href="https://applybc.ca">ApplyBC</a>. This upgrade would create a template for the application form, first for Simon Fraser University, then for other post-secondary institutions in the province.</p>
            <p>When I joined, they were well underway creating wireframes in Balsamiq. I fleshed out the details in the wireframes, and created click-through versions of the wireframes for testing. The click-through wireframes revealed many small features that had been overlooked on the first pass, such as pop-up boxes and error messaging. As well, the click-through wireframes were used to demonstrate the design to SFU's project management office.</p>

            <p>With the wireframes in hand, I helped implement the front-end of the SFU application. I was responsible for most of the HTML and CSS, working with the designer and developers to create a pixel-perfect implementation of the design. As well, I was involved in researching possible JavaScript frameworks to use, although time did not permit using them. Once the front-end was completed, I shifted to documenting the GWT widgets in the application and organizing our QA testing of the upgraded application.</p>

            <p>This being the first of many user tests on the new ApplyBC applications, it was important to set a baseline for future tests. I was given extra time to prepare, which I used to write a detailed test plan and research the think-aloud method thoroughly. My goal was to design a test that was rigorous, repeatable, and produced useful results.</p>

            <p>The user test went remarkably smoothly. We had exactly the number of recruits we needed and all tests ran on schedule. Our findings were summarized in a report describing exactly where usability problems were found and their severity. I was responsible for designing and editing the report, in addition to writing much of it. The report was used to prioritize the subsequent upgrades made to ApplyBC, which have since corrected the issues we found.</p>
