            <p>This started off innocuously, as a Christmas present for my father. He's a long-time fan of Civilization 4, and I thought it would be nice for him to have a copy on his wall, made more legible and more clearly labeled than the the one that came in the box.</p>

            <p>The original technology tree appears to be a linear path from left to right. However, the arrows have different meanings. One arrow is a mandatory path, two are different options. Some paths aren't even shown as lines, instead they are indicated by icons in the upper right of each box.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>However, once I started trying to understand the workings of the technology tree, I realized this was actually one of the most complex tree structures I had ever encountered. It’s a non-linear tree with many overlapping paths, more like a maze than a tree. The original designer’s approach was to hide this, making the chart look much simpler than it actually was. My first attempt at a design was to reveal the hidden paths and organize them.</p>

        <div class="right">
            <p>A first try at redesigning the tree, showing all of the paths that were hidden and identifying optional paths by colour. A major improvement in consistency, but much more of a maze.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>The biggest issue I identified with this first draft was that the paths were often extremely long, which made it very likely that they would overlap. I tried shifting the positions of the technologies around, with little luck doing better. Some brief experiments with algorithms to optimize the nodes suggested there wasn’t much to gain. So instead, I tried wrapping the nodes around in a circle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <p>I’ve gone from a maze to a hairball. Not much progress, it seemed.</p>

    <div class="block">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Finally, it hit on me to try merging the circle and tree concepts into one: this allowed for me to create a visually clear arrangement for the paths with a minimum amount of space. It also made for a good visual metaphor, showing the progress of technology in game as spokes in a wheel.</p>
