            <p>In fall 2015, I took a course in typography at Emily Carr University of Art + Design. Aside from a general interest as a designer, I realized that typefaces (or fonts, if you must) are especially important for the web. As vector objects they scale well, which is a useful feature when creating responsive designs.</p>

            <p>The goal of this poster was to showcase a typeface. I was interested in blackletter type because I had rarely used it, and I thought it would prove to be an interesting challenge to research. That led me to discovering Unger Fraktur, a somewhat forgotten but attractive variant of the Fraktur blackletter family.</p>

            <p>My approach to the poster was to inform designers about what made Unger Fraktur unique, hopefully encouraging them to use it (and use it properly). I highlighted the predecessors of Unger Fraktur, older fraktur blackletters and Didot. In particular, I examined the components of the glyphs, showing how they borrowed and combined parts from such wildly different typefaces.</p>
