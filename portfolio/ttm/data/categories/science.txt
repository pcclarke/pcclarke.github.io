SEN_The mad scientist %CLBRTY has unleashed their deadly %SCARYT upon you. How will you escape?
SEN_As a member of the senior %ORGNZG research team, you need to figure out how to promote your new invention, the %COMOBJ, to the world. How would you market it?
SEN_Scientists have recently discovered a formula that grants %ABILTY, however you've heard it could lead to being %BADSIT. Would you drink the formula?
SEN_A %FIGURE has offered you large %FINAST if you will have %CHALLE by the next year. Is it worth it?
SEN_You've successfully bred the first talking %ANIMAL, but the other members of your %ORGNZN have called it immoral. Do you agree with them?
SEN_Your %RELATN has grown the first %ANIMAL meat in a tube. Persuade the audience to try it.
