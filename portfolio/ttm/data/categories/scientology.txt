SEN_While promoting their new %MOVIEG movie, %CLBRTY has come out as a scientologist. Would you still watch their movie?
SEN_Your %RELATN is a member of the elite scientologist %ORGNZN, and is offering you a free %COMOBJ if you join. Is that enough?
SEN_%CLBRTY has hired you to promote scientology to %GROUPS. How will you do so?
SEN_You are a famous %FIGURE who has gained %ABILTY because of your faith in scientology. What powers we would get if we converted to scientology?
SEN_Your body has been infested by the spirit of a confused %ANIMAL because a %SCARYT blew up a volcano that killed it. Deliver a speech that will convince the spirit to get lost!
