SEN_As the %FIGURE of the starship %VEHNAM, give a motivating speech to your crew before a battle with fearsome %GROUPS.
SEN_Your friend has written a Star Trek fan fiction story in which %FICHAR takes command of the starship %VEHNAM, encounters a %GROUPI and decides to %HARMAC. Narrate their story for us.
SEN_In Star Trek there is a mirror universe, where everything is the same but more evil. And everyone has goatees. What would %PLACEI be like in the evil universe?
SEN_%CLBRTY has recently declared that they would rather shove a %COMOBJ into their eyes than watch another episode of Star Trek. Do you agree with them?
SEN_A bunch of your friends have dressed up as %GROUPS for a Star Trek convention. Would you want to join them?
