            <p>Writing this paper was like being in a murder mystery. The subject of my paper, Trygve Haavelmo, had virtually disappeared from econometrics despite having set the foundations for econometrics and winning a nobel prize for doing so. His thesis, The Probability Approach in Econometrics, implemented for the first time a working method for using statistical probability in econometric analysis. Yet every econometrics textbook since the 1960s made little to no mention of Haavelmo, including the one I read when I took a course in econometrics. Where did Haavelmo go?</p>
            <p class="quote">Early reviews of Haavelmo found his paper to be an extremely difficult read [Morgan 1990: 254] and that some of the reviewers probably did not even understand what Haavelmo had wrote. Aldrich argued that because Haavelmo laid down the reasoning for the structure, Johnston took it for granted that he could concentrate on using that structure [Aldrich 1989: 34]. Due to Haavelmo being so difficult to understand by the layman, and that he had been so successful at laying the groundwork for econometrics, textbooks progressively ignored Haavelmo until he was forgotten.</p>
            <p>Unlike so many other papers where my research was done through online journals, this paper involved digging through fifty years worth of dusty old textbooks to pinpoint when Haavelmo left the econometrics mainstream. In so doing, I learned a great deal about the theories behind statistics and econometrics. However, what left a lasting impression was the ability of econometricians like Haavelmo to weave math, data, and charts together to communicate complex economic theory.</p>

            <p>The method of econometric research aims, essentially, at a conjunction of economic theory and actual measurements, using the theory and technique of statistical inference as a bridge pier. But the bridge itself was never completely built. So far, the common procedure has been, first to construct an economic theory involving exact functional relationships, then to compare this theory with some actual measurements, and finally, "to judge" whether the correspondence is "good" or "bad." Tools of statistical inference have been introduced, in some degree, to support such judgements, e.g., the calculation of a few standard errors and multiple-correlation coefficients. The application of such simple "statistics" has been considered legitimate, while at the same time, the adoption of definite probability models has been deemed a crime in economic research, a violation of the very nature of economic data.</p>
