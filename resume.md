Work Experience
-----------------------

**Education Analyst, Fraser Health**
April 2016 – July 2017

I joined the Learning Services team of Fraser Health on a one-year contract, continuing my interest in health from studying arthritis as a research assistant. My role was to design websites, banners, and educational materials to inform Fraser Health staff about new or changing technologies in health care.

- Wrote a script using jQuery for the Management Centre intranet to generate web application launch buttons across multiple pages, so that when vendors change addresses links could be easily updated

- Organized content and created wireframes for the Telehealth (videoconferencing) intranet sub-site, simplifying dozens of pages of sign-up documentation into one step-by-step online process

- Created an emergency poster to alert all Fraser Health staff about the WannaCry ransomware that was designed and finalized in hours by rapidly iterating feedback from IT and communications into the design

- Conducted guerrilla user tests on my own initiative in the Fraser Health offices to learn how effective Learning Services' webpages were, revealing for the first time how staff discovered them

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft SharePoint

**Technical Writer/Developer, FINCAD**
May 2013 – May 2015

This began as a co-op position to design and contribute to FINCAD’s documentation system for F3, their financial analytics framework. Impressed with my performance, my contract was renewed for 2 years. It grew into a role to maintain and upgrade the documentation system, as well as design other UIs.

- Wrote guide and code samples for using F3 SDK features in Java, C#, and C++. Support calls on those features virtually disappeared

- Redesigned layout and appearance of documentation that was generated HTML from XML using Python. Clients were pleased with the changes, calling them “elegant” and "more readable"

- Designed and implemented a CMS in Bootstrap for a Django-based web application, completing it well before the features it needed to support were available

- Authored documentation in XML for Excel and web API products, translating finance and software development concepts into plain English

Technologies used: XML, DTD, LaTeX, Python (Django), Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Axure, C, C++ (Boost), C#, Java, Visual Basic, Visual Studio, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap, jQuery, Grunt), RESTful APIs, Apache Subversion, Git, AWS (Amazon WorkSpaces)

**Visual Analytics Research Assistant, SFU CZLab**
May 2014 – May 2015

While a research assistant supervised by professor Chris Shaw, I studied how fitness trackers could be used to help people with arthritis. My challenge was to design an interface that would connect patients and health practitioners, showing how much and how often patients need to exercise.

- Designed UI prototypes in Adobe Illustrator, Axure, and Processing that were used to apply for and which won grant funding for my research

- Learned how to authenticate the Fitbit API with OAuth 1.0a to access data in web applications and on Android devices, then taught other researchers how to access it

- Performed data analysis with the pandas Python library that specified the goals set by physiotherapists into targets which could be achieved with fitness trackers

- Created a functional web application using the d3.js JavaScript library that impressed test participants, senior citizens with arthritis, with how clearly it presented their fitness goals

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (D3.js), Java (Processing, JavaFX), RESTful APIs, OAuth, Adobe Illustrator, Axure, Python (Pandas)

**UX Designer, BCcampus**
May – December 2012

My first co-op term through SFU, my role at BCcampus was to follow the upgrade of ApplyBC (now merged into EducationPlannerBC) to include the online application form for SFU. I contributed to the design, development, and testing of the webpages in the application.

- Created click-through wireframe prototypes in Balsamiq mockups, and demonstrated them to clients to show how online application would function

- Implemented HTML and JavaScript front-end of site to pixel perfect specifications, in addition to documenting and testing GWT widgets written in Java

- Performed heuristic evaluations, accessibility evaluations, and user tests. The tests were planned thoroughly so that they followed a repeatable script and produced valuable feedback

- Edited and co-wrote report summarizing user test findings in Adobe InDesign. Report was well received by management and government, ensuring continued development of ApplyBC

Technologies used: Balsamiq, Java (GWT), CVS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Selenium
